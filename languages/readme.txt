LANGUAGE TRANSLATION FILES FOR COLOR PALETTE GENERATOR
---------------------------------------

If you are interested in creating a language translation for Color Palette Generator
(CPG) then you've found the right place!  Your help is greatly appreciated and allows
CPG to be more easily used by people all over the world.
CPG uses the language that is configured for WordPress in wp-config.php
and so it can support any language for which a translation has been provided.

The language files used by WordPress and CPG are extremely simple
to create and edit, however a plugin or software application is required to work
with the file formats.  The only difficult part is actually translating the
text into the new language!

A ".po" file is a plain text file that you edit using a plugin or application.
You simply enter a tranlations for each phrase.  Once all of the phrases have
been translated, you use the software to generate an ".mo" file. Save both
of these files in the color-palette-generator/languages folder and it will be used on
all CPG configuration pages.

HOW TO CREATE OR UPDATE TRANSLATION FILES:

The easiest way to create WordPress translations is with the Codestyling Localization
plugin at http://wordpress.org/plugins/codestyling-localization/. After
installing the plugin, simply login as admin and go to Tools -> Localization.
Refer to the plugin documentation for instructions.

If you prefer desktop software, POEdit is a free application to view and
edit translation files: http://sourceforge.net/projects/poedit/. You can copy
and use one of the existing .po files as a starting point.

WHAT DO I DO ONCE I'VE CREATED A TRANSLATION FILE FOR CPG?

For Github users:
Go to https://github.com/houke/color-palette-generator and create a pull request
with the new or edited translation.

For non Github users:
Once you have created the .po and .mo files, zip them up and upload them
to either a file sharing service, your own blog, or any public server
where I can download them.

Once the files are available, post a message on the CPG Support Forum at
http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/color-palette-generator and let me know where to get
them.

Thank you for supporting CPG.
